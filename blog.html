        <p>
One day i was almost bored to death at home, frustrated and angered by series of disappointment the previous day due to some business deal that didn't go through. That morning kids were playing, screaming and yelling like little demons all over the compound, disturbing the peace out of everbody because it was a holiday. A neighbor's generator was at the backyard groaning like a pregnant woman experiencing child labour, this was the most annoying part because it won't stop and i couldn't think in the midst of all that noise pounding my ear drum from the backyard, i almost went crazy. That's when i remember my culinary therapeutic routine helps whenever i am experiencing in-life-distress disorder. So i turn and head back home because at this point i couldn't even remember where i was going or while i was walking in the first place. 
    </p>
    
<p>
    For those of you who would really love to stop by for a nice coffee, warm soup, heavy dinner or gossip, i gladly give directives to my where i stay below and its a humble place not a castle.
</p>
    
    <p>
        <h5><strong>Direction</strong></h5>
        <ul>
    <li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
    <li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
    <li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
    <li>My house is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
    <li>Walk very slow and raie your hands up and i will welcome you in</li>
        </ul> </p>

<p>And i like to make soup, stew, fries and all. I just love to work in the kitchen when i am not coding or watching my favourite TV shows. I have a list of the recipe i used last in my culrinary experiment. Quick hummus recipe; This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h5><strong>Ingredients</strong></h5>
						<ol>
							<li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzobeans)</li>
							<li>175g of tahini 6 sundried tomatoes Half a red pepper</li>
							<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
							<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
                            <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
						</ol>
					  
    <p>
        <h5><strong>Instructions</strong></h5>
        <ul>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li> 
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time, but if you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    <li>For a different flavour, you can try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
        <ul/>
            
<p><h5><strong>Storage</strong></h5>
<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months. </p>
